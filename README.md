# MCE-550-Final-Project

This project focuses on the exercises of chapter 4, 5, and 6 for the book "A Concise Introduction to Robot Programming with ROS2" by Francisco Mart√≠n Rico.

A few notes:

  -To visualize the navigation2 SmacPlannerHybrid planner, you must have cloned the navigation2 repo.
  
  -To visualize different controllers and planners, kindly follow the commented out sections of tiago_nav_params.yaml under src/book_ros2/br2_navigation/params/tiago_nav_params.yaml
  
  -A report is available that explains all our implementations.
