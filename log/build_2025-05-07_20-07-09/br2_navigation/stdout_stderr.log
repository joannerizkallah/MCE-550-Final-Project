CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:6 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findnav2_smac_planner.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "nav2_smac_planner", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "nav2_smac_planner"
  with any of the following names:

    nav2_smac_plannerConfig.cmake
    nav2_smac_planner-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "nav2_smac_planner" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or
  set "nav2_smac_planner_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above
  files.  If "nav2_smac_planner" provides a separate development package or
  SDK, be sure it has been installed.
